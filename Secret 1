Q1. An automoile company manufactures both a two wheeler and a four wheeler . A company manager wants to make the production of both types   of vehicle according to the given data below.
1st data , TOTAL NUMBER of vehicle = v
2nd data, Total number of wheels = w
The task is to find how many two wheelers and four wheelers need to manufacture after given data.

Example 
200 -> value of v
540 -> value of w

Output :
TW = 130
FW = 70

Ans-
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int wheels (int v, int w)
{
  int x=0;
  
  if (w % 2 != 0 || v>w || w<=2)
    cout<<"invalid\n ";
  else
  {
      x=(4*v-w)/2;
      return x;
  }
}
int main ()
{

  int v, w;
  cout << "Enter number of vehichles\n";
  cin >> v;

  cout << "Enter number of wheels\n";
  cin >> w;

  int x = 0;
  x = wheels (v, w);
  cout << "Two Wheelers" << x << "\nFour Wheelers" << v - x;


  return 0;
}
